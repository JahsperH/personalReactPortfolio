        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio! I'm passionate about creating beautiful and
          user-friendly web experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a strong background in front-end development and enjoy working
          with modern technologies like React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies,
          experimenting with design, and enjoying a good cup of coffee.
